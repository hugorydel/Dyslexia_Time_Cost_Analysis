Table 2: Gap Decomposition & Counterfactuals
====================================================================================================

                 Component Gap (ms) 95% CI % of Total
                 Total gap     93.6      —       100%
                                                     
    Shapley decomposition:                           
         Skip contribution     34.9      —        35%
     Duration contribution     64.3      —        65%
                                                     
Equal-ease counterfactual:                           
            Dyslexic saved    105.7      —          —
             Control saved     86.3      —          —
           Gap shrink (ms)     19.4      —          —
            Gap shrink (%)    20.4%      —          —

Interpretation:
Duration pathway drives 65% of the reading time gap. Equal-ease text (shorter, more frequent, more predictable words) reduces the gap by 20%, with dyslexics benefiting more (106ms saved) than controls (86ms saved).
