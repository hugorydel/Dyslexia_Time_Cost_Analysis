                   Metric    Mean SD                                   Note
                 Skip AUC   0.689  — Average of control and dyslexic models
              Duration R²   0.078  —         Pseudo-R² (explained deviance)
    N observations (skip) 322,776  —            Combined control + dyslexic
N observations (duration) 200,504  —                     Fixated words only

Note: Separate models fitted for control and dyslexic groups.
Models include tensor product te(length, zipf) interaction.
