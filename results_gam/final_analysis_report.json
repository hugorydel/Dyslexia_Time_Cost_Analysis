    "interpretation": "Results show that word-level features (length, frequency, predictability) significantly affect reading time in expected directions. Dyslexic readers show amplified effects for 2/3 features, indicating greater sensitivity to word difficulty. The dyslexic-control reading time gap is explained by either differential sensitivity or text difficulty."
